Stratigraphic Correlation Tool

Correlator is a standalone package used for stratigraphic correlation and producing standard
depth map tables that can be uploaded into USIO laboratory information management system (LIMS).
The application facilitates the adjustment of core depth data drilled in a multi-hole scenario
by correlating measured whole-core (GRA, MSLP, PWC,NGR) or half-core (RSC) sensor data across
holes using an optimized cross-correlation approach.

The system provides the capability to correlate almost any numeric data set that is available in the
LIMS. Correlator is also used to correlate data from core intervals to insitu data from
downhole logs. Correlator produces several depth maps that are referred to as the affine,
splice (in meters composite depth, or mcd), and equivalent log depth (ELD) tables. LIMS data import/
export are facilitated with a downloader program that provides standard format data and
uploaders that then transfer depth tables back to LIMS for access when using data queries.

Correlator can be run on  Windows and MacOS operating systems.
